        <h1>Abstract</h1>
With significant data missing in a point scan, reconstructing a complete 
surface with sufficient geometric and topological fidelity is highly
challenging. We present an
interactive technique for surface reconstruction from incomplete and sparse scans of 3D
objects possessing sharp features. A fundamental premise of our interaction paradigm is 
that directly editing data in 3D is not only counterintuitive but also ineffective, while working with 1D 
entities (i.e., curves) is a lot more manageable.  To this end, we factor 3D editing into 
two &quot;orthogonal&quot; interactions acting on skeletal and profile curves of the underlying
shape, controlling its topology and geometric features, respectively. For surface completion, we
introduce a novel skeleton-driven <em>morph-to-fit</em>, or <em>morfit</em>, scheme which
reconstructs the shape as an ensemble of generalized cylinders. Morfit is a hybrid operator which optimally interpolates between adjacent
curve profiles (the &quot;morph&quot;) and snaps the surface to input points (the &quot;fit&quot;).
The interactive reconstruction iterates between user edits and morfit to converge to a
desired final surface. We demonstrate various interactive reconstructions from point scans with
sharp features and significant missing data.</td>

with direct sweep from automatically extracted skeleton (green) and automatically fitted profile curves (red), shown in (e1). However, due to
significant missing data, e.g., near a junction between stems, and the dramatic profile change between the leaflet and petiole at the front, the
automatic sweep result still contains artifacts. Editing of only three profile curves, as shown in (e3) with top and bottom rows showing the
before and after of curve editing, the artifacts are removed, resulting in a faithful organic plant reconstruction (e4).</p>

how user interactions progressively improve the reconstruction. To accurately reconstruct over regions with significant missing data, Sharf et
al.’s method requires proper placement of 2D tablets (colored profile planes in top row), on which topology information is specified (red !
inside, yellow ! outside). Here, these tablets were placed with great care for achieving better results. However, it is still hard to fully cover
regions with significant missing data, e.g., near a thin structure where data is almost entirely missing (a2 and a3). Inside of a tablet, the user
needs to correct the wrong topology or geometry by “painting” over wrong inside regions using red scribbles (a1) and wrong outside regions
using blue scribbles (a2). This process is quite tedious and prone to imprecisions, e.g., due to slightly misplaced tablets, leading to rough and
low-quality reconstruction results (a3 and a4). In contrast, morfit relies on user interaction on 1D curves where 6 skeleton edits, 3 profile
curve edits (see before and after shown in (b2) and (b3)), as well as 3 sweep path strokes and 3 sharpening strokes, provide the fine-grained
topology and geometry controls enough to obtain a faithful and quality reconstruction (b4).</p>
